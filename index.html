      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a 19-year-old student. I was previously enrolled in the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs as a Medical Laboratory Sciences major. I chose coding as a new career path due to the endless opprotunities in the field. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am born and raised in the beautiful city of Colorado Springs, Colorado. </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p> I used to be a competitive volleyball player. Now, in my free time, I enjoy playing video games and creating various digital art designs. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be working on a video game development team, either working with the Nintendo team or designing a game similar to The Legend of Zelda series.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Monument, CO. Monument is about twenty to thirty minutes north of Colorado Springs. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Not only is web development the fastest-growing field currently, but it is full of so many opprotunities and learning experiences. I want to work hard at web development and expand my horizons as greatly as I can. The sky is the limit with this kind of work! I would ideally like to work on some sort of software that can be applied to a big company for their own ease as a company to provide greater growth for them. I also would like to get into freelance coding for people on the side.
